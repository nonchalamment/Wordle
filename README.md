## What is this?
In this project, I recreated Wordle, a popular puzzle game from the New York Times. The objective of Wordle is to guess the correct five-letter word. Letters that are in the correct position get highlighted in green. Letters that are not in the correct position but exist in the solution get highlighted in yellow. Letters that are not in the word at all are highlighted in dark gray. Players get a maximum of six guesses to get the correct word. In the original version, Wordle is a daily puzzle with one answer provided per day. In this version, however, you get unlimited plays thanks to the reset button! 

## How do I play?
You can start playing by inputting your guess using the provided keyboard. As you click the keys, the interface shows the letters you've clicked so far. After you input your guess, you can press the enter button to check your answer. If you'd like to delete letters from your current guess, there's a handy backspace key that you can click on to erase your guess.

## What's different about this version?
As mentioned before, there is a reset functionality that allows you to play the game infinitely. This version also allows guesses that are not proper words, but please don't abuse that!

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git

## Next Steps
The keyboard is supposed to change colors as the same as the puzzle but I did not get around to implementing this feature.
